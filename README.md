# BAAAHS Central

A new website for your favorite sheep. Based on our now standardized development language [Kotlin].

This is really basic at the moment, you might even consider it a bit of a placeholder. However because we're printing instructions on inventory sheets that are going in bins right now immediately for all the new [sparklemotion] hardware and cabling we need to have a little something out there on the internets.
